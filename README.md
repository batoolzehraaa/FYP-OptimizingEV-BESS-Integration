# FYP Co-Simulation Scenarios â€“ EMT & Phasor Domain Co-Simulation

This repository contains all simulation codes developed during the Final Year Project, focused on co-simulation of EMT and phasor domain models for various power system scenarios.

## Project Scope

This code supports simulation-based case studies, including:
- Fault ride-through (FRT)
- Tap change and control response
- Peak shaving using EV integration
- Real-time data exchange between OpenDSS and Simulink

## Requirements

- MATLAB/Simulink
- OpenDSS
  
## Usage

Each folder includes a `README.md` or notes describing how to simulate that specific scenario. Simulink and DSS files are organized per case.

This repo is part of the Final Year Project
